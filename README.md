Contently takes your content and turns it into a consumable API for your [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) site. The headless content management library, no matter what framework you're using.

⚠ Currently being rewritten.

## Goals

- fast performance
- easily approachable

## Example

```
📦 current working directory
 ┣ 📂 posts
 ┃ ┣ 📄 Hello-World.md
 ┃ ┣ 📄 Second-Post.md
```

```ts
import Contently from 'contently';
import ContentlyTransformMarkdown from 'contently-transform-markdown';

const contently = await new Contently({ cwd: './posts' })
	.use(ContentlyTransformMarkdown)
	.find();

for (const file of contently.files.values()) {
	console.log(file.slug);
}

/*
  output:
  hello-world
  second-post
*/
```
